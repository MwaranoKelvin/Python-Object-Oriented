# OOP Demo: Superhero & Vehicles üöÄ

## üìñ Overview
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python through two assignments:

1. **Assignment 1: Superhero Class Design**
   - A `Superhero` base class with attributes, methods, and encapsulation.
   - Subclasses (`FlyingHero`, `TechHero`) that extend functionality and override methods.
   - Covers **constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.

2. **Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge**
   - A `Vehicle` base class with subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`, `Bicycle`).
   - Each subclass implements the same `move()` method differently.
   - Demonstrates **polymorphism via method overriding**.

---

## üõ† Features
- Encapsulation using protected attributes (`_strength`, `_energy`).
- Inheritance with specialized hero subclasses.
- Polymorphism in both heroes and vehicles.
- Clear demonstration of OOP concepts with real examples.
