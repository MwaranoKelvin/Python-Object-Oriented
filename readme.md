# 📱🚗 Python OOP Assignment  

## 📖 Overview  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python through two activities:  

1. **Activity 1 – Custom Class:**  
   - `Smartphone` class with encapsulation (private/protected attributes, getters/setters).  
   - `GamingSmartphone` subclass to demonstrate **inheritance**.  

2. **Activity 2 – Polymorphism Challenge:**  
   - `Vehicle` base class with subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that override the same method `move()`.  
   - Shows **polymorphism** in action: same method call, different behaviors.

## 🛠️ Features  

### Activity 1: Smartphone & GamingSmartphone  
- Encapsulation with private/protected attributes.  
- Methods for powering on, installing apps, and checking status.  
- Inheritance via `GamingSmartphone`, which adds gaming mode and GPU features.  

### Activity 2: Polymorphism with Vehicles  
- Base `Vehicle` class defines a generic `move()` method.  
- Subclasses override `move()` uniquely:  
  - 🚗 Car → `"Driving"`  
  - ✈️ Plane → `"Flying"`  
  - ⛵ Boat → `"Sailing"`  
- Demonstrates **method overriding and dynamic behavior**.
